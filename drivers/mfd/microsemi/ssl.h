 * \brief System Service Layer. 
 *
 * System Service Layer is combination of 3 header files :
 *
 * ssl.h - Master file that prototypes functions and data structures to be ported
 * 
 * typedefs.h - Base file defining data types as used by layers above
 *
 * vproc_dbg.h - Debug header file ported for debug messages. If no debugging 
 *               supported, implementation to leave function/macro as stub but 
 *               still should define
 *
 * This is Platform-Specific layer and must be ported to host platform-specific 
 * function for correct functioning of HBI Driver over host platform
 *
 * Expected and Intended use of data structures and functions are explained
 * here. In case of confusion, developer may reach at <>

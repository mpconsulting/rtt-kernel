*
* This is an API specification document for Microsemi Voice Processor Class of  
* Device SDK. This document covers platform-independent Host 
* Bus Interface(HBI) And platform-dependent System Service Layer(SSL).
* HBI API are implemented over SSL.
* Below Diagram gives an overview of different components in system

*
* Microsemi only define System Service Layer as an abstract API set . It should 
* be ported by developer responsible for porting HBI Driver for a particular host platform.
* HBI Driver and Microsemi VPROC SDK is assisted by various compile-time options 
* which gives flexibility to host to configure Microsemi Voice Processor Device 
* and software as per their system requirement ex. SPI/I2C, endianness, memory resources.
* Below tables summarizes both HBI and System-wide various compile time options

* \defgroup hbi Host Bus Interface
* Host Bus Interface define control path communication to Microsemi VPROC Devices.
*
* Microsemi VPROC device control path communcation is divided in to transport 
* and physical layer where Transport Layer sits on top of Physical Layer.
* Physical layer define actual bus protocol to use at ground level.Current 
* Microsemi VPROC Devices support SPI and I2C as physical interface. 
* Transport layer define a device specific protocol and termed as
* Host Bus Interface (HBI).
* Following section covers API of HBI Driver to configure VPROC Devices.
* 
* \defgroup ssl System Service Layer 
 * System Service Layer is Platform specific Abstraction Layer.
 *
 * This layer prototypes API and data structures. It should be implemented by
 * developer responsible for porting HBI driver over host platform.
